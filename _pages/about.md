I am a graduate student in Aero/Astro at Stanford University. In my undergraduate studies, I pursued a major in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. In 2020, I was awarded the Mathew Isakowitz Fellowship. I am particularly interested in research topics related to Artificial Intelligence, Guidance/Navigation/Control, and Space Domain Awareness.
